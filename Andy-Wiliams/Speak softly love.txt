Speak softly love

Speak softly love
And hold me thender ?????
?????
????? moments start
??????
?????????

Wine colored days wormed by the Sun
Deep velvet nights when we are one

Speak softly love
And no one heard us but the Sky
??????
?????? until we die
My life is yours
And all because
You came into my world with love so softly love
