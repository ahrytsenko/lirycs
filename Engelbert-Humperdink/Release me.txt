Release me

Please release me, let me go
For I do not love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Release me and let me love again

I have found a new loveding
And I will long ways one her need
Her lips someone ...???
Release me, my darling, let me go

Please, release me, let me go
For I do not love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
So, release me and let me love again

Please, release me, can you see?
You'd be a ... to plan to me
To le.. to bring us pain
Release me and let me love again
