Take my Heart

You said You finished with love,
That You never love again as long as You live.
But belive me, You love me again,
If for once You finding in your heart to forgive

Take my heart
I can undo what I wrong lets start
Just a little bit of love goes far
You begin to live again

Take may heart
Common back where you belong lets start
You can do it if you take my heart
You begin to live again

Now that you've seing the bad side
There the chance that you wount find a hart to forgive
But belive me there's always the good shine
In a world just made for us where love is can live

Take my heart
I can undo what I wrong lets start
Just a little bit of love goes far
You begin to live again

Take may heart
Common back where you belong lets start
You can do it if you take my heart
You begin to live again
