How near is Love

They tell me how far
When you'd fly to the Moon
And name of the stars
That shine above.
On Venus and Mars
We will be very soon
But I whant to know
How near is love

When you close to me
I could touch the sky
At times I can see
Heaven in your eyes
You don't know the pain
Of loving in vain
So please tell me now
How near is love
