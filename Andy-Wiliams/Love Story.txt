Love Story

Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than a sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start?

With her first "Hello"
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
That never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my hart

She fills my hart
Of very special things
With (???) sun
As while the measurings
She fills my soul with so much love
And anyway I go
I'm never lonely
With her alone
Who could be lonely
I reach for her hand
It's always there

How long does it last?
Can love be magic by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now, but this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars open away
And she'll be there

How long does it last?
Can love be magic by the hours in a day
I have no answers now, but this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars open away
And she'll be there
