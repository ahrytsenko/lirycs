Nature boy

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
?????? very far very far
Over land and sea

A little shy
And sad of eye
But very wise
Was he

And than one day
A magic day 
He passed my way
While spoken we so many things
Fools and kings
That he said to me
The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return
