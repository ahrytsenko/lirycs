Nature boy

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
Hi said hi wandered very far very far
Over land and sea
The little shy
And sad in eye
But very wise was he

And than one day
A magic day he passed my way
??? many things
Fools and kings
That he said to me
The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return
