How near is Love

They tell me how far
When I fly to the Moon
And names of the stars
That shine above.
On Venus and Mars 
We will be very soon
But I whant to know
How near is love

When you close to me
I could touch the sky
?????
????? heaven in your eyes
?????
?????
But please tell me now
How near is love
