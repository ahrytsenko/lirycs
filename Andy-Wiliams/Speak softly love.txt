Speak softly, Love

Speak softly, Love
And hold me warm against your hart
I feel your lips
That tend to trembling moment start
Where we alone ???
Are very own ???
Sharing a love that only few have ever know 

Wine colored days warmed by the Sun
Deep velvet nights when we are one

Speak softly, Love
So no one hears us but the Sky
The ??? of love 
We make will live until we die
My life is yours
And all because
You came into my world with love so softly love

Wine colored days warmed by the Sun
Deep velvet nights when we are one

Speak softly, Love
So no one hears us but the Sky
The ??? of love 
We make will live until we die
My life is yours
And all because
You came into my world with love so softly love
